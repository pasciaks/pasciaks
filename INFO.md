# Review Your Project Checklist

- You might want to know if you're on the right track as you complete your project. Does your project contain everything it needs to solve the case and stand out to potential employers? To answer that question, take a look at the checklist below.

### HTML Proficiency: The learner should demonstrate a deep understanding of the HTML, how it specifies the page content, as well as integration with CSS and JavaScript. The following should be included:

- Appropriate HTML tags used as they were intended

- Page content formatted in a clear, precise format

- No outdated or deprecated constructs (such as using tables as a layout tool) or tags

### CSS Proficiency: The learner should effectively use appropriate CSS constructs (class, ID's, etc) to control content formats and presentation. The following should be included:

- Well-organized classes and judicial use of IDs

- Attributes clearly delineated and structured without excessive overrides

- Layout and designs are responsive to different device screen sizes without hard-coded pixels for elements

### JavaScript Proficiency: The learner should demonstrate the ability to use JavaScript to control user-interactions and business logics. The following should be included:

- Provides user-interactivity for the website

- Demonstrates the understanding of the relationship between HTML, DOM, and JavaScript

- Not used as the sole method to control format or to control screen size responsiveness

- Use sensible variable and function names

- Clearly commented

- Bug-free

### Design and Integration: The learner should demonstrate the ability to produce a well designed website product that engages users by integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following should be included:

- A clear understanding of the separate roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, no CSS or JavaScript code (except function calls) were embedded into HTML tags.

- All the code should be well commented and easily understood by humans and easy to maintain

- The design of the site is free of excessive distraction, excessive colors

- The viewers are drawn to the most important content of the site

- Navigation should be simple and straight-forward. Viewers should easily find what they are looking for. For example, where is this person's contact information?

- All links should work properly
